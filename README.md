<h2 id="collected">Data TorBox collects</h2>

<p>TorBox does not require personally identifiable information to register or use the service.</p>
<p>As a TorBox user, at any point, TorBox may be retaining the following information about your account:</p>
<li>Registration information. This includes email, hashed password and timestamps of account creation.</li>
<li>Information about downloads. This one is a little complex so let's talk about it. When you add a torrent, we record the fact that you downloaded a torrent. This log stays in our database forever. It simply says "This user downloaded a torrent at this time". We don't permanently store torrent information. The information we do store in our database, or caches is metadata about the torrent. This includes information like name, hash, magnet link, download speed, upload speed, status and more. This information does not include anything about the user other than who started the download. When you delete a torrent all metadata about the torrent is deleted permanently. All that will be left is the record that you downloaded a torrent, like we explained a bit ago. The torrent data is available to you and to you only. TorBox does not look at or access your torrents without express permission (usually done in support tickets). Your torrents you download are for you and you alone. No one will ever know you downloaded it.</li>
<li>Analytics information. We use SimpleAnalytics for analytics, which is a privacy first analytics platform and only takes in your device model, and the browser you are on. Pretty neat right?</li>
<li>Other than that, it's third parties. You can view them and their privacy policies below. We try and make smart choices about who we choose to partner with, but if you have any complaints about privacy, you will have to contact them.

<p>That's it! Crazy right? In a world where all your data is being harvested, TorBox likes to go against the flow and reject taking your data.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="not-collected">Data TorBox does not collect</h2>

<li>Your IP. No need to use a VPN with TorBox, or do, who cares?</li>

<li>Your location. That's basically just IP, but we thought we would mention it anyways.</li>

<li>Your interests. No, we don't look at all the "Linux ISOs" you download to know what type of clothes you like to buy. We don't sell you ads. We don't care who you are, but we care about you <3.</li>

<br/>

<h2 id="sharing">Sharing of data</h2>

<p>We don't sell your data, however little that may be, to any third parties or to ourselves. Your secrets are safe with us. We do in fact share some data with third parties, but we keep it to a minimum. At max, it is your email and internal user ID, but usually it is nothing.</p>

<br/>

<h2 id="data-use">Use of data</h2>

<p>TorBox uses the above collected data for the following uses:</p>
<li>Registration data allows you to log in and access your account from any device. Pretty simple.</li>
<li>Information about downloads allows you to have a rich experience on the dashboard. All that data gives the dashboard the information it needs to serve you, and allow you to view your torrents with the most information of any debrid ever. You always know what the torrent's status is. Even if the torrent is no longer seeding, you can still have cool data about that torrent. If you delete it from your dashboard, that data is gone forever.</li>
<li>Long term storage of the downloads (remember the "This user downloaded a torrent at this time" part?) is used for a more rich experience, allowing you to view your basic stats. For free users, allows us to add a limit on how many, and how often free users are allowed to download new torrents.</li>
<li>Analytics allows TorBox to see how the service is doing, and where users are coming from, and what parts of the site are the most popular, allowing us to tailor the experience for the users.</li>
<li>Your email also allows us to send you notifications about your account. You can change this setting at <a href="https://torbox.app/settings" target="_blank">https://torbox.app/settings</a></li>
<li>Third party data can be used for a lot of things. You will have to read more about each one on their own privacy policy pages.</li>

<br/>

<h2 id="erasure">Right to Erasure</h2>

<p>Want your data deleted? No problem, simply contact us with your email and it will be gone ASAP. This will delete anything associated with your account, even including 3rd party data. This process is somewhat manual (we have scripts to do it faster) but you still have to contact us for us to run said scripts.</p>

<p>Data such as information about torrents are deleted as soon as you request your torrent to be deleted. This can be done on the dashboard, by clicking on the torrent, and clicking the delete button, or by the API.</p>
